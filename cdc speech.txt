Higher education is not all that easy as it seems. Right from financial constraints to lack of funds and scholarships at universities, problems are many. There are many universities and academic centers of excellence that support higher education facilities at their campuses. But, to provide the required infrastructure and research facilities for higher education, it needs an equal amount of investment in terms of time and money on the part of the college.

Hence, higher education costs are usually exorbitant and unreachable to the common masses. A scholarship facility or a provision to avail study loans will definitely help in this matter. Reservation for category and minority students is another issue in our country. The cream of the rank achieving lot gets absorbed by the premier institutes of the country. But the remaining large percentage runs helter skelter to find a good place for an opportunity in higher education.

Right from the esteemed institutes of technology to universities, colleges, academic centers, reservation is like a plague that hits every path that we tend to move. Meritorious and deserving students in the unreserved category find it very difficult to have a foot hold or find an opportunity to seek a place in higher education. Similarly, conservatories and seminaries that impart religious knowledge seek members of their own community to take place in collaborative studies, leaving out many deserving candidates to find shade in the sun outside.
